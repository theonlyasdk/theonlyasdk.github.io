/* I was watching a video related to Firefox getting a new update which implements
  the view-transition API, so I decided to know more about this API which I've never heard about
  before. After reading the docs for some time and seeing the demos, I was convinced and I wanted to 
  implement it into this blog, and I did.
  For now, the animation only shows up in mobile devices as my potato can't handle it in desktop 
  resolution.

  See: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document
